<p style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Kanni, apparently they relayed to your father yesterday…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Mm-hmm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: That they do not want to give any infrastructure portfolio to Balu or Maran.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Yeah. But nobody, who told it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: No, no. He was told apparently very, very clearly, it has been…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, he was not, he was not. That is the problem. Who came and told him?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: They came in or, you know, told him or they must have spoken to him and Prime Minister spoke to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No. Prime Minister did not. I was the one who was talking with him. I was on the phone and he – Prime Minister said a few words, that’s all. And see, Prime Minister can’t talk on a phone to dad and convey, there is obviously… Prime Minister is also, you know, very soft spoken and dad can’t hear that clearly also.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Mm-hmm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: They might have told somebody that, you don’t know whether that person is conveyed [Indiscernible] [0:01:02].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Okay. Let me find out who they conveyed it to, my God there is so many people working on the thing, it’s unbelievable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Yeah. See even somebody is [Indiscernible] [0:01:18] lower level could have conveyed, they couldn’t have come and conveyed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Okay. Okay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: All that is there, you know, and it depends on the credibility of the person who came and conveyed it, whether coming from them or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Right. Right. Right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Even I got a news like this but I don’t know – somehow, somebody senior who has convey it, you know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: That’s right. That’s right. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right, I’m going to just tell them again, yeah. I’ll call you back then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: And see one more thing is that one of them can call Ghulam can call me and tell me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: And I can go and tell dad and but somebody has to come and say, yes they’ve said it. So, otherwise it would reflect very badly on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Right. Right. Okay. Okay. Listen, I’m meeting your mom at 12:30 hopefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Okay. I’m here, I’m around.</span><br /><img class="img-responsive" style="" src="/images/273/3862590456_dcf26f1493_b.jpg" alt="3862590456_dcf26f1493_b" width="" height="" /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Okay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: No, no, no, no.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: That won’t happen, ask Ghulam to call me and talk to me. I’ll be here around, you know.</span></p>

<p style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Hello.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Hi. Listen, they’re caught up in a meeting, but they are going to speak to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Pardon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: They are going to speak to you, that message has gone to them. What also that I have just mentioned to them is that you’re not, only Raja was supposed to have gone to the swearing-in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: So they’re like little, they’re so sort of [Indiscernible] [0:00:49.0] about the whole thing, they don’t understand what’s going on. So, I told them….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, they just want to come and say that whatever happens, I’m in your side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Who wants to say?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Whoever, that guy who, Daya is going, no?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Daya is not talking to Ahmed Patel, Daya is not talking to Ahmed Patel, I don’t know who Daya is talking to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Okay. No, no, Daya is going to the swearing-in, no?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: No, that’s what I’ve heard from Congress that he has given his name, that he is going to the swearing-in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: I don’t know, he is supposed to come back with me. So, I mean, it’s just that he’s going out to say that whatever – in spite of whatever my leaders says, I’m [Indiscernible] [0:01:32.4].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Yeah, but your dad should be told, no?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: That is what, he will come and give some stupid cock and bull story to him. He will say Ahmed Patel – no, no, he will come and say Ahmed Patel called. He said at least you should come, you’re the only representative, that you’re the face of DMK. If you’re not there, it won’t be good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: If your dad were to say to him that I only authorized Raja to go, no? If your dad said, dad to tell Raja to tell Maran that I only authorized Raja not you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, dad won’t, no way [Indiscernible] [0:02:09.5] have to call up dad and tell him, no I can’t.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: I know you’re fed up of it, but this is only a start, no?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Politics, my dear.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18pt;"> </p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: You don’t mind doing politics with other people, yes [Indiscernible] [0:02:30.3].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: I know, but it’s okay, but I know you are frustrated with him, so just leave him, just ignore him and you know he’ll soon become irrelevant. But you have to….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: [Indiscernible] [0:02:38:6] it’s not that. No, no, it is not that, you know. See, I don’t mind [Indiscernible] that somebody is against your own party and leader, that is what….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Yeah, but then your father has to understand it, he’s not understanding, so you have to tell him that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: How do I make him understand, keep telling, he doesn’t understand….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Who is going to make him understand? Only you can do that. Nobody else, Kanni. He will not listen to anyone else except you. You know that, the only person who is going to listen to because none of the others, everybody else is still scared to go and tell him that. You’re his daughter, so he can listen to you. You have to use your position, Kanni, you have to. If you want to save the party, you’re going to have to use it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: I’ll do my best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Yeah, you take care, I’ll call you….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Anyway, I’ll be leaving to the airport at 4 o’clock….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Yeah, that’s doesn’t matter, so they’ll call you in Chennai, but they’ll know that they have to speak to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Then, I’ll be reaching Chennai around 7:30 if possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Then, when they call you, you just tell them, you please come to Chennai if you want to talk, whatever you want to talk come to…</span></p>

<p style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>May 22, 2009, 20:04:19</strong></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Hello, it’s not true Kanni. So why should we tell him, there’s no need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, no, I will just make sure because he is trying to spread the thing that….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: No, no, no. Prime Minister has already clarified that the deal has not been, we’re still in the middle of discussing, there is no point of…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: They have promised to give us telecom, but it cannot now become [Indiscernible] [0:00:34.7] they’ve already told us they will give us telecom, now it shouldn’t be given to him because he is going around planting the stories that….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: But ignore that, because he was planting it on the channels when you were on the flight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Yes, yes I know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Yes, I know that and then I spoke to Raja, I spoke to Chennai also. I got an input as to what had happened. I went back and told the channels that there’s no deal that has been closed, Janardan Dwivedi is the one who had said. Janardan Dwivedi was the one who made the statement that the deal had been closed with the DMK. There is no need for us to travel to Chennai. Then, the channels asked the prime minister.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Yes, yes. That I know. No, no. I’m not saying that. I’m just saying be careful, because it shouldn’t, because he’s trying to get somebody from the congress say things against Raja to dad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Nobody said anything; the prime minister has not made a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Not the prime minister. When they come to meet dad…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Agreed. But Kanni, the prime minister has just made a statement that I have no problem with Raja and Baalu, they’re my esteemed colleagues. Prime minister has just made that statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: He can make a statement, but whoever is going to come and talk to dad shouldn’t talk otherwise. Because, see, what people say outside and what actually they mean is very different and all of us know that in politics. You can always call somebody your friend and then come and have a discussion and say, see, I don’t want this person. That is for public appearances, we do a lot of things. So I’m just saying make sure that whoever is going to come and talk doesn’t talk against this guy, because I heard from another source that they….</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Well, okay. Yes, I spoke to Raja also.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: See, Raja is one person who will say everything is not a problem; everything is okay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Yes, yes, yes. I don’t think Congress is in any mood to discuss what portfolio should be taken, they’re going to leave it to your father, is what I was told by both the.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, no. I’m saying all that is fine. But they shouldn’t come and say anything, because I’m sure they will come and say something against Baalu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Yes, Baalu, they are saying. They’re saying against Baalu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, but they also want to say, I think, against Raja.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: They’re saying they’re not going to…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Even one line against him will definitely take more to this guy. Actually they say that we’re very happy to give it to Raja, because he did a good job and things like that. Then it will be, it will work in his favor. Even if they don’t go back, it is okay, but if it is going to go against him, one word against him [Indiscernible] [0:03:28.3].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Have you heard this other thing from DMK, which is that they’re saying that your meeting, whatever, whenever that’s going to happen, tomorrow is it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: The DMK meeting, zonal one, that they may just suggest that both, all three males, Raja, Baalu, Maran, should be removed and see new names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, no, no. I don’t think that is happening, no, no. But just make sure of this, one second.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">***</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>May 23, 2009, 09:59:02</strong></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Hello.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Hi, Kanni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Hi, Nira [Phonetic].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: I spoke to them again whether they would speak to the CM and give him some message, but they haven’t taken a call, I think what is being spread right now is that the infrastructure should not be given to Baalu and Raja. When actually what is being said is that it should not be given to Maran and Baalu. So there is also a view that, he hasn’t met Sonia Gandhi, I have confirmed that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Yeah, even I found out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: He is not met and I believe that he has indicated to somebody that he has met your father separately and had a meeting with him and briefed him on Delhi and your father had told him to quietly have a meeting in Delhi on his own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, that’s not true. Because when my – he actually asked everybody to leave and he just wanted to have a word alone. My mother, I mean, she didn’t realize that, she just took her glass of buttermilk to my father, so she happened to be there, through the entire conversation, he was trying to give [Inaudible] to him saying that it is important, we should be there, what, it’s okay, I don’t mind. So that is what he said, I mean, he hasn’t said anything alone. So dad hasn’t said anything. Today, dad has been told that nobody who is actually interested in joining the cabinet should be allowed to negotiate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Correct, correct. Absolutely, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Dad is quite okay with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Yeah, yeah. So I guess that’s the better way to do it, no?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: He is just lying and spreading…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: No, he is saying that by the way. Because I spoke to Rajdeep just a few minutes ago. So, I asked Rajdeep, I said where did you get this information from? Then he said, look I’m going to tell you something. He said Sun TV is actually working overtime in spreading news to my, all our correspondents, not only ours, but Times Now and everybody else. They are working overnight to just spread information and he said I recognized it last night, they gave us wrong information when they said that it had been done, the deal was signed, you know? Yeah, and he said I recognized, so I’m very conscious of it, but this whole aspect of infrastructure not going to Raja and Baalu is very dangerous. And I said, look I don’t think you should be, prime minister has already clarified all this. So then again I spoke to my, the Congress and asked them whether there was any statement like this on infrastructure. They said, we’ve given the births, we have not said anything else. Telecom is already infrastructure. So if prime minister has any reservation, then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: See, telecom is, like we only asked telecom for Raja.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Correct, correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: If they have problems, they wouldn’t have given it back to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: They said exactly that. They said exactly that, that infrastructure is telecom, we don’t have any problem with it but what he has done is, he has used that very cleverly by saying infrastructure is not, because Raja and Baalu are not welcome. I’m the only one now who fits for telecom, because he doesn’t want to go to labor or chemical fertilizer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: He doesn’t want to go because it’s not good for his image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: That’s right, that’s right. So just to let you know that that’s the way he has used it cleverly and Congress is…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: You should [Indiscernible]. He is very – see, let us – yo should tell them also, Nira. He is the one who is actually creating half the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: I did that, yeah. This morning, all my messages to everyone went that it’s he is the only one. And I explained the whole Alagiri expect, that they have to understand that he is a mass leader. And in any case, in any party, priority would always go to a mass leader.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Yeah, so he is not a mass leader and therefore he is not a priority, he is trying it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: We have other elections coming [Indiscernible] [0:04:06:6]. We do not want to antagonize all his followers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Yes, correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: But actually one thing is you can tell them also, even if they are not happy, you can do exactly what Lalu did. You can get a good MOS under him, who will answer [Indiscernible] he has to deal with, he will answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Correct. Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. I don’t think they have a problem with him, by the way. They don’t have a problem with Alagiri. Congress has no problem with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, no, so that is a problem. But this guy is the one who wants telecom and he is spreading rumors, but I don’t think even the DMK is interested in giving him telecom.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: I don’t think so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Because we’ve got our own channel and then it will go against us also.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: But look, Kanni, you need to [Indiscernible] [0:04:55.1] deal with his last mile later on, but we really have to deal with that whole issue because of his blackmail to the other channels, which is the only reason he has been able to do what he is, confusion he is able to create. But you have a meeting in the afternoon, is it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, nothing like that. But then whoever is going to come to take over communication, they should come, go. I mean, I think the government should insist on going in a big way about the Dish TV or whatever, or to make sure the entire cable network is open to everybody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: No, we’re doing that. We are going to work on the policy on, we’re going to set a lobby for it. That the last mile has to be dismissed, we’re very, everyone is fed up, all the channels are fed up. I’ll tell you that. We’re starting that process. We’re not – even we all go together on that issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Not just in Tamil Nadu, all over the country…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: All over the country. Because you have to be fair, you have to be equitable to everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Exactly. I mean, nobody should have this kind of a stranglehold on, anybody for that matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: That’s right, that’s right. I mean, what Jayalalitha had done against him was the right thing. She had taken it into the state. That was the right thing. But Kanni, your father hasn’t decided who the MSB [Phonetic] [0:06:08.5] is going to be, right, for negotiations?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: I think they will decide today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: They will decide today. [Audio Gap]. This whole thing of wanting extra birth, and how he spread it the last two days is giving you a very, very bad impression, very, very bad impression. Somewhere on the line your father has to come up…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: I think – today, I think it will get sorted out. [Indiscernible] [0:07:05.6] because I am worried one extra word this way, that way will completely go…</span></p>

<p style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>May 24, 2009, 09:27:31</strong></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Hello.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Hi, good morning.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Sorry for I wake you up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: No, no [Indiscernible] [0:00:17] yeah, a few minutes back I got up, you know, hi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, no, I just wanted to know, I mean, what they are planning to give for me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Mm-hmm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: What are they planning to give for me?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: I told you last night. I called after we spoke and I said that, you know, look at the health option. But give her environment and forest otherwise if the health is not there, independent charge or consider the aviation one. You know, that’s the three I had said, you know, what else there was, there. So, they weren’t sure. [Indiscernible] [0:00:52] pass the message and they will talk with you because they didn’t want to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Even tourism is not worth it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Tourism independent charge they will not give you Kanni because Ghulam Nabi Azad has still not given his, he wants something more than what you call it. He has got only parliamentary affairs, you know.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Okay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: They don’t want to give MP more than that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Okay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: That’s why. So, I did mention tourism because I don’t know because they will keep it up to cabinet post.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Okay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: I didn’t know whether they will [Indiscernible] [0:01:22] because if tourism and culture together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: It’s got both the – we’ll get involved in all the umbrella of temples and, you know, all this such thing [Indiscernible] [0:01:35] if you want to but anyway, I mean like tell them now if you want. But I didn’t tell them…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, no, I’ve given the list of that but anything and.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Why did you give the list on and what did you tell them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: I just gave environment, health and tourism and culture also, they have added. They said they he will check it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Mm-hmm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Maybe I’ll ask for Environment, Environment they won’t give, health they won’t give, you know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Health I think, they have already allocated. It is my sense I think they have already allocated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Environment they will give, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Independent charge? Yeah. You gave a list this morning, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Yeah. I have given a list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: You didn’t put aviation, Kanni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: You know, just an aviation I will take it up. No problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Because that would – but what about this one the others?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Nothing. They said they’ll come back and tell us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: What they can give, you know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Yes, yes. Let’s see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Has the meeting happed this morning?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, no, not yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: What time is it starting?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: I think it’s 10, 10:30.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Okay, you’ll be there, you know. Just you again, you know, not the others, you know.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: And Alagiri, has he met your dad?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, no, no.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: That’s what you opted, you know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: Mm-hmm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Okay. Good, good. Because I was wondering whether he would meet him. He would have spoken to him on the phone, you know…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, no, no.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, I hope you…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kanni: No, no that one isn’t, that isn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nira: Maran has?</span></p>
