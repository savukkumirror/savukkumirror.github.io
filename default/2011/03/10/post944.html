<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp;Though we have come across numerous cases of fence eating the grass, the incident which you are about to know would shock your conscience, because, this is not done by a person in the lower echelons of police, but a top cop who is going to be a Director General of Police at least for seven years.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Last week, the website <a href="http://www.tamilleader.in/">www.tamilleader.in</a> published a story of how the enforcers of law broke the law in all possible ways.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Paazeee Forex Trading. This name not only sounded ‘quick money’ but also lured thousands of greedy depositors who pumped in their money for a quick buck.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">The modus operandi adopted by the firm was by collecting deposits from the public in return for huge returns. For example, a 50,000 deposit in the firm would yield a return of 1,40,944/-.&nbsp;&nbsp; One fine day the post dated cheques issued by the firms bounced for ‘want of funds’ and complaints poured in.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">The Coimbatore police registered cases against the Directors of the company under various sections of Mohanraj, Kathiravan and Kamalavalli.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is when trouble began for Kamalavalli.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img class="img-responsive" style="" src="/images/944/DHINATHANTHI_22_10_10.jpg" alt="DHINATHANTHI_22_10_10" width="" height="" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #ff0000;">KAMALAVALLI</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Kamalavalli, in her complaint, a copy of which is in possession of Savukku, has made scathing allegations against the police brass of Coimbatore District.  After the intervention of High Court of Madras in the bail petition of the Directors, the Directors had given an undertaking before the Court that they would settle the money to the depositors.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Kamalavalli says, “On 29.10.2009 as per the direction of Tiruppur DSP Rajendran, we have settled 1.80 crores to the customer K.B.Vellaichamy and their groups. But the cheque has been issued not to the individual customers. It has been issued in the name of K.B.Vellaichamy and their groups. But the cheque has been issued not to the individual customers. It has been issued in the name of K.B.Vellaichamy by 4 cheques. Out of 1.80 crores, the capital cheque amount is just 1.02 crores. Rest 78 lakhs is the excess amount paid as per the instruction given by DSP Rajendran.”</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">This DSP Rajendran who played havoc in the entire episode has made crores in the entire scam. But obviously Rajendran at the level of Deputy Superintendent of Police could not have taken all the money for him. The hierarchy in the police would never permit an officer at the level of DSP to make so much money, without sharing the booty with his superior officers. There was a ‘hand of god’ behind every action of DSP Rajendran.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Kamalavalli continues. “On 02.11.2009 Tiruppur Crime Branch has formed a Committee stating that, refund should be processes only through the committee. As per the direction, we issued the cheque on 20.11.2009.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Meanwhile on 27.11.2009 DSP Rajendran informed us to pay Rs.6 crores to the Erode customer Sadhasivam and their groups. Out of 6 crores, the capital amount is only Rs.4.5 croroes. The rest Rs.1.5 crores is the excess amount for that cheque has been issued in the name of Duraisamy and Sadhasivam. Out of 6 crores, 75 lakhs has been passed. For the balance amount, the company has given stop payment to the bank as per our lawyer advise to us, as we ascertain that amount is not delivered to the respective customers.”</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">In each and every refund that has been made by the Directors, a sizeable sum went to the pockets of DSP Rajendran and the ‘hand of god’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img class="img-responsive" style="" src="/images/944/Kamalavalli-4.jpg" alt="Kamalavalli-4" width="" height="" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Kamalavalli further adds, “On December 1<sup>st</sup> week, one day evening around 4 pm, CCB (Central Crime Branch) Inspector Shanmugiah came along with at present CCB Inspector Mohanraj to my office to meet me. CCB Inspector Shanmugiah informed me to talk with Mohanraj and left the room. But that particular time, Mohanraj and left the room. But that particular time, Mohanraj never introduced himself as he is a Inspector and he was not in uniform. He discussed with me regarding the customer repayment. I asked him whether he is our investor. But he told he is a person to help us in two manner.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">If possible to repay</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Inability to repay the customers.”</span></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Just look at the dubious way of these goons in the cover of uniform.&nbsp;&nbsp; When thousands of depositors had lost their money and waiting to recover at least part of it, the custodians of law are suggesting the cheater not to repay the money. Not only have these goons betrayed the depositors, but also had earned crores of illegal money from the culprits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img class="img-responsive" style="" src="/images/944/Kamalavalli-5.jpg" alt="Kamalavalli-5" width="" height="" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Kamalavalli : “But I clearly told him, we 100% able to repay our customers, immediately he dialed a number from his mobile, stating that Mr.Annachi is on line and he wants me to talk with him. I denied but he forced me to talk with him. He also asking me the same and if at all I could not pay, he will help us to come out from this problem. I simply gave the line to Insp. Mohanraj and got it and hanged the line. Insp. Mohanraj was asking me 3 crores to close this case. But I refused to do so, immediately he told me I am here to help you any time and left the office premises.”</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Who is this mystery man Annachi ? This mystery man Annachi is an accused wanted by the CBI in a forged passport case. The case against John Prabakaran @ Annachi was registered by the CBI in the year 1991.&nbsp;&nbsp; Annachi jumped bail and a Non Bailable Warrant was issued against him. While the CBI was searching for the Annachi all over India and issued an alert, do you know where this Annachi was ? In the heart of Chennai City holding an enviable position as President of Indo Polish Chamber of Commerce. He was presiding functions and inaugurating numerous commercial ventures in his present capacity.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But his luck ran out in 2009 when the CBI picked him up. He managed to get bail. This is the annachi who was an agent, go-between, tout, etc. for the hand of god.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Kamalavalli continues. “Only after days, I came to know that he is Insp Mohanraj from Anaimalai Station. After this incidence, we got a lot of pressure from all the sides.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Meanwhile, Inspr Shanmugaiah keeps on coming to office requesting to pay the amount of Rs.3 crores demanded by Inspr. Mohanraj as he is not able to tolerate the torture from Inspr. Mohanraj. But, I clearly informed Inspr. Shanmugiah, we cannot pay the above said amount. Only after this I start getting anonymous calls to my mob No. 99408 00008 from unknown no (VOIP) to settle the amount of 3 crores.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img class="img-responsive" style="" src="/images/944/Kamalavalli-6.jpg" alt="Kamalavalli-6" width="" height="" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">On 8<sup>th</sup> December, as I was not feeling well, I could not present in my office in the morning. But in the afternoon, I promised to settle Madurai customers of Rs.5 lakhs. Since customer was waiting for long time I started office around 4.30 pm from my house in Chevrolet Spark Vehicle No.TN-39-AR-2999 along with my driver Karunakaran.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Around 4.40 pm, I got down at LVB ATM which is located near by my office complen to drop the cash. Since 2 – 3 people were inside, I turned back to go to office. That time, there is a Endeavour Black Color vehicle is very near to me as already back door was open. Some one hitted me back of my head, immediately I went inside the car. Then I become unconscious. After few hours, I slowly recognized that I have been kidnapped, that time vehicle was stopped near a tea shop, that place shows Erode road. I found 3 persons apart from the driver.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">That particular day, I was holding 2 mobile phone. One in my hand and other inside my hand bag. (9003938201 / 994080008).&nbsp;&nbsp; I have taken other mobile from my hand bag without their knowledge and sent message to my partner Mohanraj to his cell number 90039 38204 that I have been kidnapped and could not identify the persons.”</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Kamalavalli was kidnapped by Inspectors Mohanraj and Shanmugaiah and DSP Rajendran on the instructions of Annachi and the ‘hand of god’. What Kamalavalli narrates further is even more shocking. “They threatened me and also Kathiravan not to give complaint to the police. They offered me food, but I refused to take. I had only water.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope they mix something, so that I frequently become unconscious.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">They showed me some pictures on TV and told me that it is me. Since I am semi-conscious I could not recognize properly.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img class="img-responsive" style="" src="/images/944/Kamalavalli-7.jpg" alt="Kamalavalli-7" width="" height="" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The pictures shown to Kamalavalli were nothing but of her own in a semi-nude state.  Showing the footage Kamalavalli was threatened that the footages she just saw would be aired on television and published in internet.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">“On 11.12.2009 afternoon around 1 pm Tiruppur DSP Rajendran North Police Station Inspector Dhanaraj came to hospital to investigate me. They sent my family members around me outside.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">DSP Rajendran was stressing me to tell what the kidnappers already informed me to state as the statement. Thus I have given my written statement as per DSP Rajendran has directed.”</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The crucial part that was not mentioned by Kamalavalli in her written statement was her being raped by the ‘hand of god’ and Annachi @ John Prabakar</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" style="" src="/images/944/john_prabakaran.jpg" alt="john_prabakaran" width="" height="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #ff0000;">JOHN PRABAKARAN</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Subsequently after reports appeared in the media about the foul play of DSP Rajendran and his men in the entire episode, he was transferred out of Tiruppur sub-division. After the new DSP Raja took over, Kamalavalli gave this complaint to the new DSP, which was forwarded to Court.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">In the second week of March 2010, the investigation of the case was transferred to Crime Branch CID wing. Kamalavalli, after case was transferred to CB.CID was in a fond hope that justice would be done for the injustice caused to her. Alas ! She was in for a rude shock for the ‘hand of god’ is all powerful to see that the investigation transferred to CB.CID is gathering dust.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Who is this hand of god ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Pramod Kumar IPS.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" style="" src="/images/944/pramod_kumar_IPS_2.jpg" alt="pramod_kumar_IPS_2" width="" height="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #ff0000;">PRAMOD KUMAR IPS</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Pramod Kumar, a native of Bhagalpur, Bihar is a directly recruited IPS officer of 1989 batch.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the time of the ‘Paazee’ episode, he was the Inspector General of Police, Western Zone.&nbsp;&nbsp; All along his service in Tamil Nadu, Pramod Kumar is known for his ‘casanova’ adventures. Sources who are in the know of things, say that right from his days as young S.P., he would insist that only woman constables are posted for guard duty at his officials residence,  for ‘obvious reasons’.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">As soon as the news about the Paazee Trading scam broke in the media and depositors started thronging the police with complaints, Pramod Kumar found a ‘treasure trove’ and got into act immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp; He pressed the services of Annachi @ John Prabakaran to closely liaise with the investigating officers in the scam. When the investigating officers were not amenable, he brought his own man Mohanraj, who was serving as Anaimalai Inspector to Central Crime Branch.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as Mohanraj got into the act, not only he collected money for Pramod Kumar, but also delivered Kamalavalli in a platter for Pramod Kumar to commit ‘rape’.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">But what Pramod Kumar or Annachi or Mohanraj failed to expect was that a timid Kamalavalli would dare to challenge them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kamalavalli’s complaint resulted in the arrest of Inspectors Shanmugaiah and Mohanraj.  DSP Rajendran managed to get anticipatory bail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img class="img-responsive" style="" src="/images/944/mohanraj.jpg" alt="mohanraj" width="" height="" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 14pt;">IINSPECTOR MOHANRAJ</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Mohanraj gave a confession narrating the role played by Pramod Kumar IPS. In his confession he clearly states that bribe money was sent to Pramod Kumar IPS in bundles. His confession was also recorded by a Magistrate.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" style="" src="/images/944/Mohan_42.jpg" alt="Mohan_42" width="" height="" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" style="" src="/images/944/Mohan-6.jpg" alt="Mohan-6" width="" height="" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/944/Mohan-7.jpg" alt="Mohan-7" width="" height="" style="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #ff0000;">CONFESSION STATEMENT OF INSPECTOR MOHANRAJ</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">At this point every one would expect that Pramod Kumar IPS’ name would be included in the FIR, and that he would be arrested.&nbsp;&nbsp; You would be in for a surprise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pramod Kumar has managed to manipulate the entire CB.CID top brass in his favour.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as Pramod Kumar was transferred out of Coimbatore and posted as IG Headquarters, he approached the ‘shadow chief minister’ of the State, M.S.Jaffer Sait,IPS to be his savior.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a citizen pleads for help, is it not the quality of an emperor to help him ? Yes. That is what Jaffer Sait did, but after receiving Rs.2 crores as bribe, according to informed sources.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">CB.CID’s ADGP Archana Ramasundaram was brought into the fold.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to information from CB.CID sources, Archana had apparently given firm instructions that not an inch should move in the Paazee case. The Investigating Officer in this case, a DSP from Cuddalore, was shown his place and asked not to conduct any sort of investigation. Manjunatha,IPS who recently took over as IG of Crime Branch CID too has fallen in line and refused to take the case out of cold storage, add sources.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img class="img-responsive" style="" src="/images/944/Archana_ramasundaram_2.jpg" alt="Archana_ramasundaram_2" width="" height="" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #ff0000;">ARCHANA RAMASUNDARAM IPS</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">T<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">he predecessor of Manjunatha, P.Kannappan was directly in charge of the investigation of this case for a considerable time. Kannappan use to command a good reputation. But reputations don’t get you promotions ?</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The complex methods of how the police manage to get things done would be astonishing. Kannappan’s case is one such thing. There was an investigating by the CBI against Kannappan. The matter relates to a murder case, where Kannappan, personally had used ‘third degree’ methods and made three persons to confess to the murder.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the confession and when charge sheet was about to be laid, the lady who was supposed to be murdered came alive !</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The three persons who were subjected to third degree methods, filed a case in the High Court and managed to get orders for a CBI investigation, which finally indicted Kannappan. The CBI had recommended departmental action against Kannappan. Due to this departmental proceedings, Kannappan’s promotion as IG from DIG was getting delayed.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Pramod Kumar used this trump card against Kannappan to give a ceremonious burial to the Paazee case. The shadow chief minister Jaffer Sait got into action and informed Kannappan that if he closes the Paazee case against Pramod Kumar, his departmental proceedings would end up with a ‘not proved’ findings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img class="img-responsive" style="" src="/images/944/DIG-Kannappan-enquirs1.jpg" alt="DIG-Kannappan-enquirs1" width="" height="" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #ff0000;">KANNAPPAN IPS</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">K<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">annappan threw integrity to the wind and acceded to this deal. Jaffer Sait managed to appoint the City Commissioner ADGP T.Rajendran as the Inquiring Authority and the departmental proceedings commenced.&nbsp;&nbsp; The complainant and witnesses in this case, were so adamant that they resisted the attempts to be bullied or bought to turn hostile. But every one has a price… !&nbsp;&nbsp; The witnesses meekly settled for transfer orders of 3 teachers, who were their relatives to ‘turn hostile’.&nbsp;&nbsp; Transfer orders were issued by the School Education department in the first week of January. The witnesses turned hostile… The departmental proceedings against Kannappan, obviously ended in an acquittal. And Kannappan got his promotion as IG.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">The Paazee case transferred to CB.CID is put into cold storage and the case file is left untouched with the possibility of it turning into a fossil.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Now every one is happy….

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">But what about Kamalavalli ? What happened to Mohanraj who gave a confession against Pramod Kumar ?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Kamalavalli who paid crores of money as bribe went into a hiding, fearing for her life on the threats of Pramod Kumar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mohanraj has been given a stern warning by Pramod Kumar that he is going to be here as a DGP for a long time and he would see that Mohanraj is finished.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mohanraj went into a shell and is incommunicado.</span></p>
