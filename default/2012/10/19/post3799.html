<p><img class="img-responsive" style="" src="/images/3799/nitin-gadkari-2009-12-24-7-44-18.jpg" alt="nitin-gadkari-2009-12-24-7-44-18" width="" height="" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">In a surprise development, a new movement &nbsp;&#8211; “India For Corruption” &nbsp;perceptibly with an intention to counter Kejriwal’s India Against Corruption has been inaugurated in New Delhi with much fanfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst the growing concerns about activists taking political centerstage which hitherto was an exclusive fiefdom of political leaders and scions which is seen as a direct challenge to democracy, IFC has been formed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">IFC, has surprisingly brought sworn enemies in the political arena under one umbrella.&nbsp;&nbsp; The leaders of Congress and BJP have come together to form this outfit.&nbsp; Many political bigwigs of both the parties are holding important positions in the new organization.&nbsp; Manmohan Singh was elected as the President of the outfit as an unanimous choice.&nbsp;&nbsp; An informed source inside the IFC said all the members were unanimous that Manmohan is the only choice to lead the outfit as he has been the biggest facilitator of all the huge scams in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for Manmohan Commonwealth games, 2G and Coalgate would not have happened, added the source.&nbsp; While there was unanimity in the choice of Manmohan, the slot for Remote Wing Secretary was toughly contended by both the BJP and Congress.&nbsp; In the end, both the RSS and Sonia Gandhi were elected as two Remote Wing secretaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Speaking on the occasion, the IFC’s general secretary Suresh Kalmadi said “This movement is the need of the hour as activists and NGOs are hell bent to destroy democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only due to the activists, I was incarcerated for more than 11 months for just doing my duty bestowed on me by democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This movement – IFC would strive hard to abolish honesty from public life and put an end to the activism of activists”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">IFC President Manmohan Singh in his address stressed the need for abolition of CAG and the RTI Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; Manmohan Singh said, “Long years ago we failed to make a tryst with destiny and now the time comes when we shall substantially forego honesty. A moment comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of the nation suppressed in the cry for honesty, finds utterance.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is fitting in this solemn moment we take the pledge of dedication to be more corrupt for the benefit of India and her people and enrich our coffers for the benefit of our future generation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Instead of fighting elections once in five years, the members of IFC should come to an arrangement and share the power among themselves.&nbsp; Due to the urgent need for maintaining friendly relations with the US, such an arrangement with me as Prime Minister would go a long way in fulfilling a dream of Mahathma Gandhi of a peaceful country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">I thank Shrimathi Nira Radia for bringing all the political leaders from all parties under one outfit for a common goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the permission of Remote Wing Secretary I plan to recommend her name for Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian honour in India”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">While there was one President, around a dozen Treasurers were appointed to manage the funds of IFC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don turned activist Salman Khurshid, speaking on the occasion said, time has come to break the fingers of RTI applicants.&nbsp; Such RTI applicants are dangerous viruses who if allowed to spread would eat the soul of the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp; His wife Louise was seen applauding her husband vociferously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Entertainment wing secretary Beni Prasad Varma called upon the left wing leaders also to join the outfit.&nbsp; He said “While some of the left leaders are with us, many of the left leaders are still aligning with anti-national elements like Kejriwal.&nbsp; I call upon them to join with us and strengthen democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Nitin Gadkari, who lent his whole hearted support for the movement said “If social entrepreneurs like me are not allowed to take the land of the farmers, this country would go to anarchy.&nbsp; If farmers continue to till the lands, where would this country find places to build malls and multiplexes.. ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of maintaining poultry farms, and cooking them, we want the farmers to have cooked chicken.&nbsp; That is why we are building malls and multiplexes and fill them with outfits like KFC and McDonalds.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are being blamed for trying to improve the lifestyle of farmers”, lamented Gadkari.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Party spokesperson Kanimozhi, speaking exclusively to us and many others, said, </span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;"> “My dad has always stressed about the need of such a movement.&nbsp; In fact, from the seventies my dad has been advocating against honesty in public life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Supreme Court Judge Sarkaria had appreciated my father for indulging in scientific corruption” said Kanimozhi.&nbsp;&nbsp; When quizzed about her stand of Jayalalitha joining the movement, she said her father would take a decision in this regard after due deliberation in their family…err…&nbsp; party general council.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, her rival party’s spokesperson Dr.Maitreyan, said “Amma is the fountainhead of corruption.&nbsp;&nbsp; Amma is well experienced in dragging a corruption case for 17 long years, whereas the DMK and their party people were not able to drag the spectrum case even for 4 years and are facing trial.&nbsp; Amma is fit to hold all posts of the IFC” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Not surprisingly, the rebel groups in BJP threw their weight behind IFC and joined enmasse in IFC.&nbsp; The rebel group headed by Yeddyurappa said, “I always wanted to start such an outfit.&nbsp; Only due to Sadhanandha Gowda’s secret alliance with Santhosh Hegde, I was prevented from starting it.&nbsp; Now, my hands are free and will stand by IFC” he said.&nbsp; The Reddy brothers from Karnataka and Jegan Mohan Reddy also joined IFC and said they would fight hard to abolish honesty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">There was opposition from a section of the IFC for Rahul Gandhi joining the outfit.&nbsp; An IFC cadre, on condition of anonymity said Rahul may even spoil this outfit, just as he spoiled the prospects of congress in UP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">One of the Treasurers of the outfit Robert Vadra, was visibly angry when he spoke on the occasion.&nbsp; “The likes of Kejriwal are not only a threat to India, but also a threat to the world citizenry.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the BJP was in power, the congress had the decency to avoid criticizing Ranjan Bhattacharya.&nbsp; Similarly the BJP too has returned the favour.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, the rotten mango people, behave like third rate hooligans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These uncultured people have the temerity to say that the son-in-law of the most powerful woman in this world can’t even have five acres of land.&nbsp; If the properties and lands in congress ruled states don’t belong to my mother-in-law who else do they belong to ? Is a man prohibited from taking his own property ?&nbsp; What has this country come to ?&nbsp;&nbsp; If my mother-in-law doesn’t have the powers to take her own property who else has ?&nbsp; Who has the authority to question her ?&nbsp; &nbsp;People like Kejriwal should be confined to prison without trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even without trial, they have to be sentenced to double life imprisonment just for disturbing my peaceful life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Though there was a sense of euphoria in the event, there were murmurs from the organizations heavyweights from U.P and Bihar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Mayawati and Mulayam Singh Yadav, said there should be reservations for Dalits and Backward Classes in the leadership of IFC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laloo Prasad Yadav too said dalits and backward classes are sidelined in IFC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">However, Maharashtrian heavyweight and corruption stalwart Sharad Pawar said, reservation in IFC would come at a later stage as the movement has just started.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, reservations for the wards of senior leaders is a must for the organization to grow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Supria Sule too echoed her father’s views.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">A.Raja from the south who was not able to participate in the event, lent his wholehearted support and also stressed a point that dalits should be given preference in the movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">The new movement IFC is seen by political analysts as a phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Political analyst Yogendra Yadav said “This is a new phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp; This shows that Indian democracy is maturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counter forces to Arvind Kejriwal would only enhance the debate and make India a mature democracy”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">The inaugural session adopted the following resolutions.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abolish Comptroller and Auditor General</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeal the draconian Right to Information Act</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Withdrawal of all cases registered under the Prevention of Corruption Act throughout the country</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediate dismissal of officers in the bureaucracy who talk about honesty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Round the clock prohibitory orders against any demonstration or agitation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendments to Criminal Procedure Code empowering the police to arrest anyone who talks of honesty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking against corruption to be made an “unlawful activity” and brought under the purview of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make suitable amendment to the Constitution to make corruption as a fundamental right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 12pt;">The movement also resolved to propagate the resolutions and the noble aim of India For Corruption throughout India and seek the help of bollywood stars in this endeavour.</span></p>
