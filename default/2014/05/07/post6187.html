<p>The Tamil Nadu police investigations into the IPL scam continues to be a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.</p>
<p><a href="http://tamilwhip.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/4714858-3x2-940x627.jpg"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/6187/4714858-3x2-940x627.jpg" alt="4714858-3x2-940x627" width="" height="" style="" /></a></p>
<p>While their Delhi and Mumbai counterparts have filed their respective  charge sheets swiftly against the accused, including Gurunath Meyyappan, the Crime Branch CID, Chennai  pretends as if it is groping in the dark to get at a black cat that doesn’t exist! And thus despite relentless media pressure.</p>
<p>If anything the state police seemed more eager to cover up the tracks of the culprits and help them escape the long arm of the law.</p>
<p>In a curious turn of events, Sampath Kumar  IPS, the cop who was probing the IPL scam in his capacity as SP, Q Branch, found himself in the dock, while the big fishes like Gurunath Meyyappan and Vikram Agarwal were let off with no more than a slap on the wrist.</p>
<p>News items were planted that Sampath Kumar had received huge sums of money from a bookie.  But he countered it by raising questions why were Vikram Agarwal and Gurunath Meyyappan not interrogated properly and how did all the bookies manage to come out on bail in a couple of days.</p>
<p>But the higher-ups seemed convinced Sampath Kumar was guilty and placed him under suspension.     The issue which was on the backburner for quite some time, came back to the limelight following the revelations of deposition of Sampath Kumar before the Justice Mudgal Committee which was appointed by the SC to probe the IPL match-fixing scam.</p>
<p>As details of the deposition became known, the main players in the IPL scam started working overtime to ensure that Sampath Kumar was arrested and the issue was swept under the carpet.  He has been suspended and news about the impending arrest is being planted in the media by CB.CID top brass.</p>
<p>With no other go before him, Sampath Kumar chose to take head on his bosses and the IPL villains and impleaded  himself in the sensational case before Supreme Court case.</p>
<p><a href="http://tamilwhip.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Sampath__Kumar_DC.jpg"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/6187/Sampath__Kumar_DC.jpg" alt="Sampath__Kumar_DC" width="" height="" style="" /></a></p>
<p>In his affidavit before the SC, he narrated the sequence of events &#8211;  particularly how he stumbled upon crucial evidence of foul play in the IPL and involvement of main players, including N.Srinivasan, President of BCCI.</p>
<p>Praying for an SIT probe,  Sampath Kumar  wanted the role of the top BCCI management and some cricket players in the betting and spot fixing scam in the IPL-6 matches to be investigated effectively.   He said he himself had been a  part of the investigations conducted earlier by the CBCID, Chennai but later shunted off and eventually suspended. He alleged that the Chennai Police had indulged in a cover up operation and not conducted the probe in a free and fair manner.</p>
<p>He claimed that it was he who had unearthed many the key details,  demonstrating  the involvement of the top functionaries of India’s apex cricket body and also of certain players, thus giving a totally new dimension to the whole scam.</p>
<p>He went on to charge, “However, due to the hectic lobbying and clout enjoyed by the people behind the scam, the applicant has been proceeded against in order to let the influential people off the hook.”</p>
<p>Refuting Sampath Kumar&#8217;s charges, Karan Sinha, who is heading the Crime Branch CID in his counter asserted, “During the course of investigation, six bookies were arrested on the date of registration of this case and based on the confession of the accused, efforts were made to arrest other bookies. In view of the role of intervener/applicant in extracting a bribe amount from the accused {bookies} and also for other delinquencies, he was suspended by the Government. In order to escape from the clutches of law the intervener/applicant has deposed falsely before the probe committee headed by Justice Mudgal.”</p>

<p>Now, in a detailed letter addressed to the DGP, Tamil Nadu, Sampath Kumar explains the circumstances under which he was forced to file the petition in the Supreme Court.   The letter of Sampath Kumar to the DGP is revealing.</p>
<p>Savukku.in had exclusive access to the letter of Sampath Kumar, which is reproduced here in full for the benefit of our readers.</p>
<p>To</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Director General of Police</p>
<p>Tamil Nadu</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Sub:         Application for Impleadment filed by Sri Karan Sinha IPS</p>
<p>ADGP/CBCID/ TamilNadu-In I.A No 7 of 2014 in the</p>
<p>Supreme Court of India- certain clarifications sent-Reg</p>
<p>“Making scathing allegations against the Tamil Nadu Police….”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">()()()</p>
<p> I was not making any allegations against Tamil Nadu Police as alleged in the petition.  I have found few officers playing hand in gloves with cricket betting Cartel and attempting to hush up to protect the influential lot by any mean. This was disclosed before the Justice Mudgal Committee.</p>
<p>“Attempt of the intervener is only to quash/stay the suspension order ..without first approaching the Central Administrative Tribunal”.</p>
<p>My first prayer to Hon’ble Supreme Court is to transfer the cricket betting cases to a Joint Investigation Team.</p>
<p>My deposition before the Justice Mudgal Committee is a secret one., in an in-camera session. It was also submitted to the Committee that the deposition may be kept secret as it contained phone numbers and the suggestion for line of investigation and few names and details. My submission was accepted and my name was not figured in the report. However, one member of the Committee chose to send a parallel report mentioning about my deposition and the details too. My deposition was in the focus of Media along with the Committee report (i.e 10/2/14 onwards) in media and in the web. I was also apprehensive that the Cartel is so influential, evidences might get tampered. My apprehensions proved right. After the leak out of the deposition the CBCID hastily tried to tie all loose ends and started recording 164 crpc statements and started tampering of evidences. Because of this leak out in Media I also have been vindictively suspended and getting framed.</p>
<p>As I am being victimised for giving evidence before a Committee constituted by the  Supreme Court of India, I  have approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court to intervene.</p>
<p>“..to make false and reckless allegations against the state Government..”</p>
<p>I have witnessed a deliberate and unethical attempt by certain senior level officials to safeguard the interest of the Cartel and were capable of getting things done at administrative level. Only that rotten lot I pointed out. What all I have deposed  before the Committee can be corroborated and a professional investigating unit can bring out the facts to light.</p>
<p>I have never made any allegations against the State Government. In fact     I am attempting to take this matter to the Hon’ble Chief Minister’s notice.</p>
<p>The Charge memo against me contains 8 charges:(in the same order)</p>
<p>Charge -1. For giving interview to “Headlines Today” News channel on      20/02/14 and endorsing my deposition before Committee.</p>
<p>Charge-2 .  For allegedly releasing my deposition copy to “Headlines Today” and “Zee News” channels.</p>
<p>Charge-3    For criticising the CBCID investigation in the interview in “Headlines Today”.</p>
<p>Charge-4     For allegedly participating in ZEE News TV program (sting operation by Zee News)</p>
<p>Charge-5     For making allegations against ..that is for talking about cover up by Senior officials in “Headlines Today” and “Zee News”  TV interview.</p>
<p>Charge-6     For allegedly giving interview to Zee News channel and making allegations against few officers and their family members.</p>
<p>Charge-7     For allegedly conspiring with one Ranka and extorting a bribe from accused in CBCID cr No 1/2013 (cricket betting case)</p>
<p>Charge-8     For  not informing a transaction in my SB account which was not intimated to the Department.</p>
<p>I was suspended on 27/2/2014 without assigning a reason. The Charge memo was issued to me on 10/4/14.</p>
<p>All the reports/documents/statements in support of the charges are after thought, they are dated after 6/3/14 i.e after my suspension on 27/02/2014 for talking to media/press. Effect precedes the cause.</p>
<p>I spoke about the CBCID not pursuing the leads given by Q branch with vested interest and few of the officials of CBCID were acting as henchmen for the Cricket betting cartel. I also felt lack of coordination among the different investigating agencies dealing with the issue and submitted for transferring the cases to a Joint Investigation Team. These are the few reasons,   I have deposed before the Committee. I endorsed that in the interview and wanted the cases to be investigated in depth.</p>
<p>I have also spoken about the strong nexus between the Cricket betting cartel and few of the top Police officers and few bureaucrats in key position ….that nexus is strong and effective enough to get things done at administrative level.  This is not against the Government. The rotten lot cannot be equated with the Government. My inference can be substantiated. For instance the call details record of the mobile 9840721963 of Vikram Agarwal the kingpin in cricket scam in Chennai revealed his deep rooted connections with persons holding key posts and the power clout he is having. Further, my inference on the illicit nexus stands proved as I have been vindictively suspended and now facing this charge. Nowhere, I have spoken about the Government.</p>
<p>Para 14 of my deposition before the Committee will throw more light on this:</p>
<p>“I submit that, It is also known that so far number of cases registered on IPL scam 2013, for instance, in Mumbai one case registered, Delhi Police  have registered one case, in Rajasthan at Jyothinagar PS  one case registered and in TamilNadu CBCID also one case. As an officer on the field, I felt there is lack of coordination among the various agencies in investigation. I further submit that all these cases may be clubbed and given to a joint investigation team including specialized agencies such as Enforcement Directorate,Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, IT , CBI and NIA. Preferably the NIA should head the joint team with the task of bringing out the larger conspiracy and the key players behind the scam ,since the scam involving large money transaction through unconventional means exposing our vulnerability and a matter of concern for Internal Security.”</p>
<p>My suggestion was well taken by the Committee and in both the reports it was endorsed to suggest for further investigation.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that except for CBCID none other (Mumbai Police,</p>
<p>Delhi Police and Rajasthan Police) have objected transfering the case to a Joint Investigation team.</p>
<p>The corruption charge against me is absolutely false allegation and exposes the heights of atrocious and henchmen like behaviour of few senior officers of CBCID. If money is my priority the Cartel would have taken care of me and I would be hushing up things. If I am corrupt I wouldn’t seek a Joint Investigation Team to take over the case.</p>
<p>It is submitted that after the arrest of the Kitty @ Utham Jain and later  Vikram Agarwal (who is a suspect in the fixing scandal) by CBCID, owing to the pressure that had arisen due to the investigation carried out by  my Q Branch team. However, due to the pressure from the influential lobby to de-rail the investigation process, a case was registered against one Mahindra Singh Ranka, who is a businessman, and was responsible for bringing Uttam Jain @ Kitty to the Q Branch.</p>
<p>The basis of the said case was the complaint of one Gowtham Chand Nimani, himself an accused in the betting case. It was alleged that he was cheated by Ranka and he was made to pay Rs. 5 lakhs. Subsequently, the CBCID with the sole purpose of implicating/framing me, prepared a case that the said Ranka was collecting and cheating people for me.  This was an absolute brazen effort by the CBCID to implicate and frame me so as to divert the attention from the actual facts that were being brought out by me in relation to the betting and match fixing scandal.</p>
<p>I have already deposed before the Committee about the ADGP/CBCID</p>
<p>Karan Singha IPS among few other officers who were successfully hampering the investigation in cricket betting case. Now the same officer filing on behalf of the Government proves my point.</p>
<p>I would also remind you, in filing a counter affidavit  Mr Srinivasan of India Cements have spoken about 164 Crpc statements recorded by CBCID and wanted the Supreme Court to call for a report from CBCID and Hon’ble Supreme Court didn’t heed. Now ADGP/CBCID filing application for  impleadment (what Mr Srinivasan wanted).</p>
<p>Why CBCID is desperate to keep me suspended?</p>
<p>In what capacity ADGP/CBCID speaks about Q Branch investigation ? (not his bonafide duty)</p>
<p>How an officer facing allegation of hampering investigation and tampering of evidence by hastily recording 164 crpc statements of accused/suspects after the Justice Mudgal  report, can file on behalf of the Government?</p>
<p>Here I would also like to put on record that on knowing the issue of injustice done to me, Senior Advocate Shyam Divan, Advocate Suresh, Advocate Vipin (Secretary, Supreme Court AOR association), Advocate Udhayadhitya (Temple law firm) of Supreme Court  and Advocate Paul Kanakaraj ( President, Madras High Court Advocates Association) and his team of Advocates of Madras High Court are taken up my case and fighting in Courts without charging any fees.</p>
<p>With regards and thanks,</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
<p>G.Sampath Kumar IPS</p>
<p>SP/Railways  (U/S)</p>
<p>Trichy, Tamilnadu.</p>
